# KeyPaws cat-proofs your keyboard

KeyPaws runs in the background and if a cat wanders onto your keyboard, it pops up a screen-saver and captures all keyboard input to stop your cat wreaking havoc on your system.

# Machine Learning to the rescue

Every second KeyPaws makes a prediction about whether a cat or a human is typing. It uses a model trained using Machine Learning techniques. 

# No network access

The model is bundled with the app. KeyPaws requires no network access.

# Nyan Cat theme

Remember Nyan Cat? KeyPaws comes with a Nyan Cat theme.

# Launch at startup

With KeyPaws you can set it and forget it, ensuring whenever your cat decides to walk on your keys, your work is protected no matter what.
