At KeyPaws we reject all products and services that allow tracking scripts or tracking cookies to be installed on our users' devices.

We don't use cookies. 

The only third-party service we use is Stripe, to handle our payments, and we embed their JavaScript using the "?advancedFraudSignals=false" flag that disables the tracking they use for fraud purposes &endash; but could use for more nefarious purposes if their management team wanted to. So we disable it.

The only time the app connects to the internet is to check the license key when a user enters it. Nothing else is sent over the network. We don't run any analytics in the app, relying instead on feedback from our testers and users.

KeyPaws has been built with love and care to protect its users' privacy.

Please email <a href="mailto:data-protection@keypa.ws">data-protection@keypa.ws</a> to talk to our nominated data controller, Alasdair Blackwell.
