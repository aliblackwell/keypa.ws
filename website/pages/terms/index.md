KeyPaws is offered "as is". Alasdair Blackwell accepts no liability for anything that happens as a result of use or misuse of the software.

We offer no guarantees that it will protect your work from your cat. Whilst it will always work if a cat goes on the keyboard while it is running, there is a chance the cat could cause serious damage with the keystrokes that KeyPaws uses to detect it. 

If you purchase a license key you are entitled to our no quibble money-back guarantee. 

If you don't purchase a license you are entitled to use the software "as is", you'll just have to load it every time you want it switched on as an unlicensed version of KeyPaws will quit without warning after two hours.
